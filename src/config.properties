info_OptionC = <html>The -c option supplies a comment string that is attached to the generated<br/>report.  This option facilitates matching queries submitted with replies<br/>received, especially when several queries are submitted at once.</html>"
info_OptionM = <html>The -m option sets the maximum number of times a given passage may appear<br/>before it is ignored.  A passage of code that appears in many programs<br/>is probably legitimate sharing and not the result of plagiarism.  With -m N,<br/>any passage appearing in more than N programs is treated as if it appeared in <br/>a base file (i.e., it is never reported).  Option -m can be used to control<br/>moss' sensitivity.  With -m 2, moss reports only passages that appear<br/>in exactly two programs.  If one expects many very similar solutions<br/>(e.g., the short first assignments typical of introductory programming<br/>courses) then using -m 3 or -m 4 is a good way to eliminate all but<br/>truly unusual matches between programs while still being able to detect<br/>3-way or 4-way plagiarism.  With -m 1000000 (or any very <br/>large number), moss reports all matches, no matter how often they appear.  <br/>The -m setting is most useful for large assignments where one also a base file <br/>expected to hold all legitimately shared code.  The default for -m is 10.</html>
info_OptionN = <html>The -n option determines the number of matching files to show in the results.<br/>The default is 250.</html>"
